## Description

Based on the work of [jseidelin](https://github.com/jseidelin) on [soe-network](https://github.com/psemu/soe-network),
h1z1-server is a library that emulates an H1Z1: Just Survive server.

## Motivation

A redditor said : "It's just matter of effort and to have enough people of with interest towards having such private servers to the respected game.
I highly doubt that H1Z1 (Just Survive) is one of those."

So we will see :)

## Setup H1Z1

### How to download it

#### Using our Launcher

[Download the latest version of h1emu-launcher](https://github.com/H1emu/h1emu-launcher/releases)

#### Using our custom implementation of DepotDownloader

[Download the latest version of H1DepotDownloader](https://github.com/H1emu/H1DepotDownloader/releases)

#### Using DepotDownloader

Use [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader) ( only work if you've bought h1z1 )

AppID : 295110 DepotID : 295111 ManifestID : 1930886153446950288

How to use DepotDownloader : https://youtu.be/44HBxzC_RTg

cmd : `.\DepotDownloader.exe -app 295110 -depot 295111 -manifest 1930886153446950288 -username username -password 1234`

### H1Z1 Dependencies

Like all games H1Z1 has C/C++ & DirectX dependencies.

You may already have them but just in case

- VC 2010 Redist

- VC 2015 Redist

- DirectX Jun 2010 Redist

You can download them all [here](https://mega.nz/file/RtwDWJ7b#QYlxpXz_t0_kp7_S8a7whnWsctJ3Fr5B2sQdnuTR9LQ)

### Setup ClientConfig.ini

On the H1Z1 game folder there is a file name "ClientConfig.ini".

Add `sessionid=0` at the beginning of this file.

And change the _Server_ value to the address of your server , probably `localhost:PORT`

### Launch the game

If you have followed the step just above this one, this step is no longer necessary, and you can start the game by double clicking on H1Z1.exe.

Execute this command in CMD/Powershell ( you have to be in your h1z1 game folder ) :

`.\H1Z1.exe sessionid=0 server=localhost:1115`

### Enable Debug log

Since v0.2.3 of h1z1-server the npm package [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) is used to make debug logs.

##### examples :

- `set DEBUG=* & node loginserver.js`
- `set DEBUG=ZoneServer & node zoneserver.js`

## Demo

- https://github.com/H1emu/h1emu-launcher/releases/latest

- [h1z1-server-QuickStart](https://github.com/H1emu/h1z1-server-QuickStart) and follow the instructions written in its README

- `npx -p h1z1-server h1z1-server-demo` to try the 2015 server via npx.

- `npx -p h1z1-server h1z1-server-demo-2016` to try the 2016 server via npx.

## Setting up a Development Environment

To set up a simple development environment for working on the H1Z1 server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/QuentinGruber/h1z1-server.git
cd h1z1-server
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```sh
npm run start-dev
```

4. Make your changes and test them using the provided scripts and commands.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Starting the Server

To start the H1Z1 server, run the following command:

```sh
npx -p h1z1-server h1z1-server-demo-2016
```

### Example 2: Connecting to the Server

To connect to the server, launch the H1Z1 game and configure the `ClientConfig.ini` file as described in the [Setup H1Z1](#setup-h1z1) section.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Server Not Starting

If the server is not starting, make sure you have installed all the necessary dependencies and followed the setup instructions correctly.

#### Issue 2: Client Not Connecting

If the client is not connecting to the server, double-check the `ClientConfig.ini` file and ensure that the server address is correct.
